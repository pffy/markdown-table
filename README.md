# PERMISSIONS

In order to provide useful features, this add-on requires permissions from you. The following describes the purpose of permissions for this add-on:

### **Google Drive** 
  + *"See, edit, create, and delete all of your Google Drive files"*
    + This permssion allows the add-on to create a `Cotton Markdown Tables` folder and save Markdown table documents on your Google Drive. Additionally, this feature allows the add-on to jump directly to the saved Markdown file or download the Markdown file to your desktop. No user data sent to pffy-cloud.

### **Google Sheets**
  + *"View and manage spreadsheets that this application has been installed in"*
    + This permssion allows the add-on to only read the content of the spreadsheet that is currently open. Reading this information helps the add-on determine how to convert betweeen spreadsheet formatting and Markdown syntaxes. No user data sent to pffy-cloud.
 
### **Script UI**
  + *"Display and run third-party web content in prompts and sidebars inside Google applications"*
    + This permssion allows the add-on to provide user interaction for better usability. HTML, CSS, JavaScript and frameworks (e.g., jQuery) are implemented in the sidebar to help the add-on copy text to your clipboard, view saved files in your Google Drive, or download saved files to your desktop. No user data sent to pffy-cloud.

### OAuth scopes
  + See the [SCOPES](#scopes) section.

  1. **Export active range:** The most basic selection in a spreadsheet.

  3. **Export entire sheet:** This method includes all the data within a sheet without user selection.
  4. **Export all sheets:** This method exports each sheet in the spreadsheet and places them into a single document.
  5. **Export selected named ranges:** Choose which predefined named ranges you want and save all the generated Markdown tables in a single Markdown document.
  6. **Export all named ranges:** Combine all the named ranges in a spreadsheet into a single Markdown document.
